<h4> What is BMI(body mass index) ?</h4>

<p style = "font-size :15px; color:black;">
    BMI is used as a screening tool to indicate whether a person is underweight, overweight,
    obese or a healthy weight for their height. If a person's BMI is out of the healthy BMI range,
    their health risks may increase significantly.BMI values are age-independent and the same for both sexes.
    However, BMI may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different populations due to
    different body proportions.</p>

<h4> What is BMR(basal metabolic rate) ?</h4>

<p style = "font-size :15px; color:black;">
    Your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is an estimate of how many calories you'd burn if you were to do
    nothing but rest for 24 hours. It represents the minimum amount of energy needed to keep your body
    functioning, including breathing and keeping your heart beating.
    Your BMR does not include the calories you burn from normal daily activities or exercise.
    Our calculator uses the Mifflin-St. Jeor equations to estimate your BMR which is believed to be more
    accurate than the more commonly used Harris-Benedict equation.
